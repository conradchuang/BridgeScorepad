<h2>Bridge Scorepad</h2>
<body>
<p><a href="scorepad.html">This</a>
is an attempt to create a web page for keeping score
during a bridge match.  The supported scoring systems are:
<ul>
<li>duplicate,</li>
<li>Chicago and</li>
<li>rubber.</li>
<p>
The page is styled for mobile devices since they are more
likely to be available at a bridge match.
The target devices are iPad Air (5th generation) and iPhone 15
because those are the devices I have.
