<h2>Bridge Scorepad</h2>
<body>
<p><a href="scorepad.html">This</a>
is an attempt to create a web page for keeping score
during a bridge match.
<p>
The supported scoring systems are:
<i>duplicate</i>, <i>Chicago</i> and
<i>rubber</i>.
Selecting a different scoring system
in the combo box at the top will clear all scores, including
the accumulated sum for all matches at the bottom.
<p>
Player names may (optionally) be set by entering them in the
text fields on the right.
Dealer may (optionally) be changed by clicking the radio button
next to the player name.
<p>
The <b>Contract</b> and <b>Result</b> input fields are for entering
information about a hand.  The final contract should be entered in
the <b>Contract</b> field using the common (case-independent) shorthand:
<blockquote>
{level}{suit}{double}{declarer}
</blockquote>
where
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>level</dt>
<dd>number of tricks bid (single digit)</dd>
<dt>suit</dt>
<dd>trump suit or no trump (single letter:
<b>S</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>N</b>)</dd>
<dt>double</dt>
<dd>double or redouble (double: <b>x</b>, redouble: <b>xx</b>)</dd>
<dt>declarer</dt>
<dd>declarer seat (single letter: <b>N</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>W</b>)</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
When a valid contract is entered, the input fields is updated
to use the "normalized" form of the input values (<i>e.g.</i>,
capitalized suit and declarer seat).  The <b>Result</b>
input field is also enabled for entering the hand outcome.
<p>
The result of the hand should be entered in the <b>Result</b>
field using a signed number.  If the contract was made, the
number of tricks taken (over book) is entered as a positive number.
For example, 4&spades; making 5 is entered as either "+5"
or just "5".  If the contract was set, the number of undertricks
is entered as a negative number.  For example, 4&diams; down 2
is entered as "-2".
When a result is entered, an alert will be displayed showing the
points scored.  For successful contracts, a breakdown of the
total points scored is given.
If the hand results in the end of a match, an additional alert
is displayed.  The final match scores are added to the
accumulated scores at the bottom, and the match scorepad
is cleeared.
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>
The web page is styled to display all elements without scrolling
in portrait mode (long edge up-and-down).
That works well for devices with sufficient screen space, but may
malfunction if there is not enough real estate to display
everything.  I find that even the iPhone 15 screen is too small
for practical use, especially when browsers auto-zoom when input
elements are selected.
